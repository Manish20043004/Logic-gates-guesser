The project aims to classify a logic gate (AND, OR, XOR) based on a truth table input.
We used a supervised learning approach — mapping known input-output patterns (truth tables) to corresponding gate types.
Since logic gate behavior is deterministic, we implemented an AI-like rule-based model to achieve near-perfect accuracy.
